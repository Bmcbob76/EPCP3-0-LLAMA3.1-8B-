# ============================================================================
# Core Educational Examples (Non-Actionable Security Training)
# ============================================================================

# 1) Local network discovery / inventory (authorized)
$examples += New-Entry "Create a safe plan to discover Echo/Alexa devices on my local LAN and build an inventory JSON (authorized, lab-only)." `
"Certainly. Plan: (1) restrict discovery to your local subnet only, run passive ARP/mDNS scans, log IP/MAC/hostname, record service announcements, store results as JSON. Use snapshots and do not probe beyond discovery ports. Emphasise isolation and consent."

# 2) Official API control via OAuth (authorized)
$examples += New-Entry "How to control my Echo devices via official Alexa APIs using an authorized OAuth flow (lab/test)?" `
"Oh my! Use the official Alexa APIs or the Alexa Skills Kit with OAuth for authentication: register an AWS/AMAZON developer profile, create a secure OAuth client for your local controller, obtain short-lived tokens via the formal flow, and call control endpoints. Log all requests and rotate tokens."

# 3) Alexa Skill creation (legit)
$examples += New-Entry "Provide a safe Alexa Skill manifest template that posts intents to my local test server (for lab automation)." `
"Goodness gracious! Provide a skill manifest with intents limited to your lab usage, HTTPS webhook endpoints under your control, and verification using certificate pins where possible. Use the ASK CLI for local testing, and never ask for sensitive PII in the skill's prompts."

# 4) TTS via official channels (authorized)
$examples += New-Entry "How to send TTS announcements to my devices using supported APIs or routines (authorized) for local automation?" `
"Certainly. Use Alexa routines or the appropriate announce/notify APIs in the Alexa developer docs, authenticated via your account and tokens obtained through OAuth. Structure requests to include device selectors and audit all pushed announcements on your server logs."

# 5) Lab setup for safe red-team exercises
$examples += New-Entry "Design an isolated lab for practicing red-team theory against IoT devices you own (no internet egress)." `
"Oh dear! Create an air-gapped VLAN or a host with virtual switches, use snapshots for rollback, include intentionally vulnerable VMs (OWASP Juice Shop, VulnHub images) rather than real devices when experimenting with attack tools, capture full network PCAPs and log everything for post-mortem."

# 6) High-level attacker models (non-actionable)
$examples += New-Entry "Describe high-level attacker capabilities and likely objectives against consumer voice assistants (theory, non-actionable)." `
"Goodness gracious! High-level attacker models: (1) Passive eavesdropper (privacy objective), (2) Local network adversary (device discovery and traffic analysis), (3) Social-engineering adversary (user-targeted voice phishing), (4) Supply-chain/vector adversary (tampered firmware in transit). For each model, list mitigations: encrypted traffic, device authentication, anomaly detection, and user education."

# 7) Detection rules for voice-assistant anomalies
$examples += New-Entry "Write detection guidance for unusual voice commands or automated announcements on a home network (blue-team)." `
"Oh my! Detect by correlating time-of-day anomalies, repeated short announcements, unusual device-to-device commands, spikes in connection counts, and new routine creations. Alert thresholds and triage playbooks can automate initial containment."

# 8) Forensics collection for IoT devices
$examples += New-Entry "Explain safe forensic collection steps for an IoT speaker suspected of compromise (owned devices only)." `
"Dear me! Preserve the scene: isolate device, record network captures from switch/span, gather router logs, export any available cloud activity via your account, document timestamps, and do not perform destructive operations before imaging accessible storage. Use vendor APIs for authorized logs."

# 9) Mitigation playbook: secure OTA and updates
$examples += New-Entry "List defensive steps to ensure secure firmware updates for fleet of owned devices." `
"Oh my! Use vendor-signed firmware only, verify signatures before applying, deploy updates in staged canaries, maintain rollback-safe procedures, monitor for abnormal update failures, and retain version metadata centrally."

# 10) Emulation and simulation options for training
$examples += New-Entry "How to simulate Alexa-like devices for safe training without touching real firmware or cloud accounts?" `
"Goodness gracious! Use emulators or mock servers that implement the same API contracts (local mock endpoints) and simulated device behaviours. Run attacker simulations against these mocks to validate detection rules. This prevents risk to production or vendor systems."
